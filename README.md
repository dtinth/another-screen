another-screen
==============

[**another-screen**](https://another-screen.spacet.me) is a web application that lets you mirror a screen locally.

- Useful when presenting and demoing but the projector is behind you.
- Useful when you want to mirror a single window on another screen. For example, I can use OneNote on my main tablet screen, and mirror it to a secondary screen which connected to a projector or livestreamed.
